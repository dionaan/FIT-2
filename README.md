# FIT-2

This game is a fast-paced game where players control a chef running along a road, collecting ingredients to create a 'pecel lele' dish. They must avoid obstacles (by jumping/not jumping) and gather the right amount of ingredients to fill up the current ingredient basket. There are 3 category of 'ingredients' able to be taken, ingredients on the list, ingredients not on the list, and trash. If you take ingredients on the list, its a point, if you take ingredients not on the list or above the requested amount its a -1 point, and if you get the trash the game will end.
